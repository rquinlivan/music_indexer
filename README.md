# Music Indexer

`music_indexer` is a tool for indexing messy directories of music files. It grew out of my need to track the different places
I was storing music files of various formats.

`music_indexer` searches a root directory for music files and generates a SQLite database file with metadata (artist, track number, etc.)
which can be used for further analysis and management scripts.
